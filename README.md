# PokemonApp
An attempt to create a Pokemon app

Initially I tried to create a React typescript app with ASP.NET Core but due to some of the issues building packages, I was not succesful in running the solution.
Then I tried to create a React javascript solution eventually. I could not get the styling done or the history of clicked items.
I tried to create display the list of Pokemons using fetch api and display details when clicked. Some of the exports still had some problems.
Also, as I used my office desktop for the easier availabilty of softwares, I did not have the permission to import the repository and had to upload files manually 
and that looks hideous without a folder structure.
